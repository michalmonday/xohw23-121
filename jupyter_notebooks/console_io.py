
# Using pynq 2.7.0 version, it is possible to set specific number of bytes to be sent when
# calling "dma.sendchannel.transfer" method. However, it isn't possible to set the number 
# of bytes to be received, because that is determined by the tlast (recvchannel.transfer method
# has "nbytes" parameter, but as mentioned in AXI DMA documentation, setting it below the number 
# of bytes received until "tlast" is asserted will result in undefined behaviour, and error 
# occurs if that happens).

# Documentation link: https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg021_axi_dma/AXI-DMA-Register-Address-Map
# Section: S2MM_LENGTH (S2MM DMA Buffer Length Register â€“ Offset 58h)
# Quote: "This value must be greater than or equal to the largest expected packet to be received
#         on S2MM AXI4-Stream. Values smaller than the received packet result in undefined behavior."

# For that reason the hardware implementation includes module that monitors AXI Lite interface responsible
# for controlling DMA (e.g. initiating transfers), and when it detects that a receive transfer is requested,
# it tells the console_io module to include a special "0xFF" byte in output buffer and set tlast HIGH as it is sent.
# This way we limit the number of sent characters to the ones that are currently in the buffer.
# As a resulting side-effect of this implementation, we can initiate transfer to check if any data is available.
